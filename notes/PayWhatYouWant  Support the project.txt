	I'm a huge fan of mechanical design, and let's be honest, so are you. That's why we're both here.

	Quyzone has quality kits designed by and for every hungry builder, brought to life with a unique, cute, whimsical touch! Our first model, the Pioneer-3 sub, is pint-sized, compact, and ready for deep-sea epicness.


	Printable: friendly for even smaller resin printers
	posable: looks awesome on shelf, thanks to precision joints
	perfectible: features modular assembly allowing for easy upgrades and deep customization.






	Like many, I went through a period of "professional reflection" in 2019.  Bored out of my mind, I grabbed the opportunity to begin work on the Mechabust project.  

	This kit was born directly out of my biggest passions: storytelling, drawing, sculpting, mechs, 3D printing, and design.
Many factors lined up to push this dream past the starting line: the time, energy, and, most importantly, the urgency. I knew I might never have this chance again: to design my very own customizable model kit of a mech bust. From that moment on, I simply trusted the iterative creative process to bring it to life.
